You will find links as you read to a robust volunteer support community
Once you are using the app, you should regularly follow one or more support forums for important updates on  Loop. Spending this time is important for success in building and operating  Loop  safely.

What is  Loop?¶
Loop  is an app you build and load on an iPhone.

After building the  Loop  app:

You enter your personal therapy settings (e.g., carbohydrate ratio, basal rates, insulin sensitivity)
You enter the carbs you eat
Loop  uses this information, your insulin on board (IOB) and glucose data, to determine how much insulin you need to bring your blood glucose within the target range you set
You can choose to have  Loop  automatically control insulin dosing (closed-loop mode) or have  Loop  recommend insulin that you manually accept or modify (open-loop mode)
